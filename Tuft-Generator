Technical Manual: TUFT-Generator v1.0 Project Name: Toroidal Unified Field Theory Resonance SystemFramework: Holofractal Vacuum Dynamics (ZPE Extraction)Author: Ondřej SedlákCalculated Precision (Proton Mass): < 0.001%Operating Environment: Autonomous Residential Off-grid Power 1. Core Mechanical Assembly Rotors (2x): 300–400 mm diameter discs made of G10/FR4 (Garolite) or High-Grade Lexan. Metal discs are strictly prohibited due to eddy current induction and thermal runaway.Main Shaft: Full Ceramic (Zirconium Dioxide – \(ZrO_{2}\)). Provides absolute electrical decoupling and prevents the shaft from acting as a parasitic antenna.Bearings: Full Ceramic (Silicon Nitride – \(Si_{3}N_{4}\)), "Dry Run" specification. No lubricants allowed to prevent dielectric drag and carbonization under scalar stress.Magnetic Array: N52UH Neodymium Magnets arranged in a Fibonacci sequence (e.g., 21 or 34 units).The Stability Angle: All magnets must be tilted at an eccentricity angle of \(\alpha =4.9^{\circ }\) (based on \(e=0.0862\)) relative to the rotation plane to create the toroidal shear.Dynamics: Counter-rotating configuration with a micrometric Gap Control (piezo-actuated) to tune the \(1/d^{4}\) interaction. 2. The Resonator (Harvesting Unit) Coil Geometry: Rodin-Toroid with a diamond-pattern winding. This geometry eliminates back-EMF (Lenz’s Law) by self-canceling magnetic vectors.Conductor: High-frequency Litz Wire to minimize skin effect and maximize scalar pulse induction.Potting: The entire coil must be encased in a Ceramic Potting Compound (e.g., Cotronics) to prevent mechanical failure during ultrasonic resonance.Spark Gap: Optical-Triggered Rotary Spark Gap (RSG). Must fire precisely at the moment of magnetic alignment (Bloch Wall intersection) to "hammer" the vacuum.
