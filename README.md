# Toroidal-Unified-Field-Theory-TUFT-A-Holofractal-Substitute-for-String-Theory
TUFT replaces String Theory with 3D toroidal dynamics and fractal scaling. By using a Stability Eccentricity of 0.0862 and Coriolis forces, it derives the exact proton mass from vacuum geometry. It unifies physics with consciousness via heart-brain coherence. No extra dimensions needed.
